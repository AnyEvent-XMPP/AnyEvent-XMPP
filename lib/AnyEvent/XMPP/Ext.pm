AnyEvent::XMPP::Ext - Extension baseclass and documentation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module also has documentation about the supported extensions
and also is a base class for all extensions that can be added
via the C<add_extension> method of the classes that derive from
L<AnyEvent::XMPP::Extendable>. (That are: L<AnyEvent::XMPP::Client>,
L<AnyEvent::XMPP::Connection> and L<AnyEvent::XMPP::IM::Connection>)

=head1 Methods

=over 4

=item B<disco_feature>

This method can be overwritten by the extension and should return
a list of namespace URIs of the features that the extension enables.

=head1 Supportet extensions

This is the list of supported XMPP extensions:

=over 4

=item XEP-0004 - Data Forms (Version 2.8)

This extension handles data forms as described in XEP-0004.
L<AnyEvent::XMPP::Ext::DataForm> allows you to construct, receive and
answer data forms. This is neccessary for all sorts of things in XMPP.
For example XEP-0055 (Jabber Search) or also In-band registration.

=item XEP-0030 - Service Discovery (Version 2.3)

This extension allows you to send service discovery requests and
define a set of discoverable information. See also L<AnyEvent::XMPP::Ext::Disco>.

=item XEP-0054 - vcard-temp (Version 1.1)

This extension allows the retrieval and storage of XMPP vcards
as defined in XEP-0054. It is implemented by L<AnyEvent::XMPP::Ext::VCard>.

=item XEP-0066 - Out of Band Data (Version 1.5)

This extension allows to receive and send out of band data URLs
and provides helper functions to handle jabber:x:oob data.
See also L<AnyEvent::XMPP::Ext::OOB>.

=item XEP-0071 - XHTML-IM (Version 1.4)

This extension allows the sending of formatted messages using
XHTML bodies. See also L<AnyEvent::XMPP::Ext::HTML>.

=item XEP-0077 - In-Band Registration (Version 2.2)

This extension lets you register new accounts "in-band".
For details please take a look at L<AnyEvent::XMPP::Ext::Registration>.

=item XEP-0078 - Non-SASL Authentication (Version 2.3)

After lots of sweat and curses I implemented finally iq auth.
Unfortunately the XEP-0078 specifies things that are not implemented,
in fact the only server that worked was openfire and psyced.org.

So I de-analyzed the iq auth and now it just barfs the IQ set out
on the stream with the username and the password.

If you insist on XEP-0078 behaviour enable the C<anal_iq_auth> option
when creating the stream.

You can also completely disable iq auth, well, just see the documentation
of L<AnyEvent::XMPP::Connection>

=item XEP-0082 - XMPP Date and Time Profiles (Version 1.0)

Implemented some functions to deal with XMPP timestamps, see L<AnyEvent::XMPP::Util>
C<to_xmpp_time>, C<to_xmpp_datetime>, C<from_xmpp_datetime>.

They are meant as simple formatters for you, you will still need to handle timezone
stuff and such yourself.

=item XEP-0086 - Error Condition Mappings (Version 1.0)

   "A mapping to enable legacy entities to correctly handle errors from XMPP-aware entities."

This extension will enable sending of the old error codes when generating a stanza
error with for example the C<write_error_tag> method of L<AnyEvent::XMPP::Writer>.

Also if only the old numeric codes are supplied the L<AnyEvent::XMPP::Error::Stanza>
class tries to map the numeric codes to the new error conditions if possible.

=item XEP-0091 - Delayed Delivery (Version 1.3)

See also XEP-0203 below.

=item XEP-0092 - Software Version (Version 1.1)

The ability to answer to software version, name and operating system requests
and being able to send such requests is implemented in L<AnyEvent::XMPP::Ext::Version>.

=item XEP-0114 - Jabber Component Protocol (Version 1.5)

This extension allows you to connect to a server as a component
and makes it possible to implement services like pubsub, muc, or
whatever you can imagine (even gateways).
See documentation of L<AnyEvent::XMPP::Component> and the example
C<samples/simple_component>.

=item XEP-0153 - vCard-Based Avatars (Version 1.0)

This extension allows to store and retrive avatars from vcards.
On top of that it will also signal others that you support avatars and
that they might have changed. See L<AnyEvent::XMPP::Ext::VCard>.

=item XEP-0199 - XMPP Ping (Version 1.0)

You can send ping requests to other entities and also are
able to reply to them. On top of that the L<AnyEvent::XMPP::Ext::Ping>
extension implements a connection timeout mechanism based on this.

=item XEP-0203 - Delayed Delivery (Version 1.0)

Both delayed delivery XEPs are supported and are implemented by
L<AnyEvent::XMPP::IM::Delayed> which is a super class of L<AnyEvent::XMPP::IM::Message>
and L<AnyEvent::XMPP::IM::Presence>.

If you need to fetch delay from stanzas you caught yourself in an event you
can use a L<AnyEvent::XMPP::IM::Delayed> object to parse/fetch the delay out of the
L<AnyEvent::XMPP::Node>.

Use the functions described above in the XEP-0082 item to decode the timestamps
of delays.

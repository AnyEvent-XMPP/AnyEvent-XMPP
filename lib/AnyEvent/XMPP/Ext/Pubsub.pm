=head1 NAME

AnyEvent::XMPP::Ext::Pubsub - Implements XEP-0060: Publish-Subscribe

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   my $con = AnyEvent::XMPP::Connection->new (...);
   $con->add_extension (my $ps = AnyEvent::XMPP::Ext::Pubsub->new);
   ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements all tasks of handling the publish subscribe
mechanism. (partially implemented)

=cut

sub handle_incoming_pubsub_event {
    my ($self, $node) = @_;
    
    my (@items);
    if(my ($q) = $node->find_all ([qw/pubsub_ev items/])) {
        foreach($q->find_all ([qw/pubsub_ev item/])) {
            push @items, $_;
        }
    }
    $self->event(pubsub_recv => @items);
}

It takes no further arguments.
